## TWEET APPLICATION


This is a single page application which lets people to tweet something and set the date and time at which the tweet is to be removed. 

#### The user doesn't need to refresh the application as it itself deletes the tweets whose time is over the present time. This filering and removal of tweets is done once in every two seconds. 

Also, the usage of react-persist allows to store the tweets in the localStorage and thus, the tweets are still available even when the application is reloaded.
